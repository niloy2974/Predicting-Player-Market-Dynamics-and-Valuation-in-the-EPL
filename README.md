# Predicting-Player-Market-Dynamics-and-Valuation-in-the-EPL
Data analytics project predicting player market dynamics in the EPL using FIFA-23, FPL, and Transfermarkt data. Applied clustering, classification, and regression to identify player archetypes, forecast transfer likelihood, and estimate market valuations.
# Overview
This project develops a player valuation model by integrating **skill attributes**, **in-game performance**, and **transfer market data**.  
It answers three core questions:
**Q1**.	What distinct player archetypes can be identified based on their performance, overall rating, and market valuation? (Clustering)
**Q2**.	Which players are the most likely to be transferred in the next season based on their performance, overall rating, and market valuation? (Classification)
**Q3**.	Which factor is the best predictor for a playerâ€™s market valuation in the future? (Regression)
