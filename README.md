# Predicting-Player-Market-Dynamics-and-Valuation-in-the-EPL
Data analytics project predicting player market dynamics in the EPL using FIFA-23, FPL, and Transfermarkt data. Applied clustering, classification, and regression to identify player archetypes, forecast transfer likelihood, and estimate market valuations.
## Overview
This project develops a player valuation model by integrating **skill attributes**, **in-game performance**, and **transfer market data**.  
It answers three core questions:
1. What distinct player archetypes can be identified based on their performance, overall rating, and market valuation? (Clustering)
2. Which players are the most likely to be transferred in the next season based on their performance, overall rating, and market valuation? (Classification)
3. Which factor is the best predictor for a playerâ€™s market valuation in the future? (Regression)
